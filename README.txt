objbrowser
==========

Python object browser implemented in Qt.

Shows an object in a tree view so that you can inspect its attributes
recursively (e.g. browse through a list of dictionaries).

From the *View* menu you can select some extra columns, for instance the 
*object ID* column.

The details pane at the bottom shows object properties that do not fit
on one line, such as the docstrings and the output of various functions 
of the ``inspect`` module from the Python standard library.

Requires: PySide (https://github.com/PySide/pyside-setup)
